  By default, UCE does not come with esword as it is a proprietary application and it is a non-linux native application..

  Would you like to install ESWORD now? It will run via wine.

    esword-install   

  You will be promted for your administrator password, so please
  have it ready.

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies may also be installed.
